# Pymesh micropython code

This repository cointains examples of the use of Pycom's proprietary LoRa Mesh network **Pymesh**.

These scripts were created and tested on Lopy4, using the release [**1.20.0.rc11**]


The Pymesh LoRa Mesh is implemented using [OpenThread](https://openthread.io/guides/thread-primer).

To understand the OpenThread terms and overall functionality, these guides are highly recommended:

IPv6 Addressing (especially, RLOC unicast address)
